PHD Python Game

PHD - Poker Hand Duel is a simple text game which you can run in your computer's terminal, IDE or wherever you enjoy running Python scripts. I'd recommend the terminal as it looks best with white text on a black background.

## Installation

Just download the .py file, or if you don't have Python installed on your computer download the .exe and associated files and just run the .exe

The python script contains only vanilla packages so no need to install any packages before running.

## Usage

If you're playing the game for the first time I'd recommend against reading the Python script first, as this would spoil the game. If you're worried about running a random .py script (as you should be) feel free to open the file and you can see that the only packages imported are time, random and itemgetter. Nothing sinister.

## Contributing
I'm not looking for contributions but feel free to play about with the code if you'd like.
